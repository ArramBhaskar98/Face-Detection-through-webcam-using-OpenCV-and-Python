# Face-Detection-through-webcam-using-OpenCV-and-Python
Real Time Face Detection
# OpenCV and Python
### Requirements
* Install OpenCV
* Install Numpy
### Operations
* Firstly create a python file where it should contain all required functions for our project.
  In my case, faceDetection.py has all required functions.
* Then download haarcascade_facefrontal_default.xml file from [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
* Then make sure to have a train and test_set images to train your cascade classifier.
* Then create a tester.py function to train your image through face_recognization technique.
* After getting trained on your images, then save it to trainingData3.yml file.
* After that predict your image from test_set.
* In the same way we can also predict our own image in a Video(Motion) Detector.
